# Stranded-Live

Stranded Live is the result of the third game jam during my second year of University.  
My team consisted of five designers and two programmers, and the game jam lasted four and a half days.  
My contribution mainly consisted of the two enemy AI types, the enemy spawning system, the enemy spawn and death effects (and set-up of the other particle systems), and some miscellaneous material utilities. I also recorded and edited a trailer on the final day, however I have not included this version of the trailer since it used copyrighted music.  
A full breakdown of my contribution can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17w_AtrGReeZEITPT9xfvg_LA7Ng1te9-heyKv4h3qfU/view#heading=h.jgh2m5w2t1uy" target="_blank">here</a> on page 102 (my contributions to this document are written in purple text).  
Our presentation outlining our development process can be found <a href="Stranded Live Presentation.pptx" target="_blank">here</a>.  
More details regarding the structure of the game jam can be found <a href="Teaching Structure.docx" target="_blank">here</a>.  
Source code and executable available upon request.
